    users.lua file

SYNOPSIS

     AuthType Basic

     # Full path to your users.lua file or users/ directory
     PerlSetVar users_lua /home/system/colloquy/data

DESCRIPTION
    Apache2::AuthColloquy is an Apache 2 authentication module. It will
    authenticate against a Colloquy users.lua user database file using the
    newer password2 field.

    This script munges the users.lua file in to executable perl code which
    is then evaluated. It should therefore be used with caution if you
    cannot gaurentee the integrity of the users.lua file. See Colloquy::Data
    for more details.
